Reducing dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis

## Research Question
<p>Can Principal Component Analysis (PCA) be used to identify which features account for most of the variance in the hospital data set and reduce the set's dimensionality?</p>

## Goal
<p>The goal of the data analysis is to use PCA to identify which features account for most of the variance in the hospital data set and to reduce the dimensionality.</p>
